Place your background audio (MP3 or OGG) in this folder and name it `background.mp3` (or update the path in `src/utils/audio.ts`).

Recommended: MP3 128-192kbps, stereo, loopable.

If you want the audio to autoplay, note that modern browsers often block autoplay until the user interacts with the page.
